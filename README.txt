RT-CSOUND
---------

A CFFI wrapper for the csound api.

This is just me playing around with LISP. There's nothing very
complicated going on here.


TODO:

 - Table funcs (e.g., csoundTableLength, csoundTableCopyOut, etc.)
 - Score Rewind?  not sure if needed
 - csoundAppendOpcode ... ad opcode implemented by LISP ?!?  fun
